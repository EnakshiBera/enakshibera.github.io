# enakshibera.github.io

This repository hosts my personal academic website using GitHub Pages.

The purpose of this repository is **infrastructure**, not research content or code.
It exists to serve static web pages (HTML/CSS) that present my academic profile
(CV, research, and teaching) at:

https://enakshibera.github.io

## Design philosophy

- Minimal and academic
- Content-first, not design-heavy
- Pages are updated incrementally
- Sections may be temporarily hidden or simplified while under revision

A placeholder page may be used when content is not ready for public view.

---

## Notes to self

- Keep file names consistent (case-sensitive)
- Update the CV PDF without changing the link name
- Avoid adding unfinished research descriptions
- Website should match CV, not contradict it
